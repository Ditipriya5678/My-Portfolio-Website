# My Portfolio Website
I am creating my portfolio website which will highlight all my skills, education, work experience, projects and contact form. This project is made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The main aim is to make this website fully responsive, so that it caters to different screen sizes and gives ease to all types of viewers.
